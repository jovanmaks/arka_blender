## Minimal Example ##

Let's start with the classic example:

```
from fpdf import FPDF

pdf = FPDF()
pdf.add_page()
pdf.set_font('Arial', 'B', 16)
pdf.cell(40, 10, 'Hello World!')
pdf.output('tuto1.pdf', 'F')
```

[Demo](http://pyfpdf.googlecode.com/hg/tutorial/tuto1.pdf)

After including the library file, we create an FPDF object. The 
[FPDF](reference/FPDF.md) constructor is used here with the default values: 
pages are in A4 portrait and the measure unit is millimeter. It could have been
specified explicitly with:

```
pdf = FPDF('P', 'mm', 'A4')
```

It is possible to use landscape (`L`), other page formats (such as `Letter` and
 `Legal`) and measure units (`pt`, `cm`, `in`).

There is no page for the moment, so we have to add one with 
[AddPage](reference/AddPage.md). The origin is at the upper-left corner and the
current position is by default placed at 1 cm from the borders; the margins can
be changed with SetMargins.

Before we can print text, it is mandatory to select a font with 
[SetFont](reference/SetFont.md), otherwise the document would be invalid. We
choose Arial bold 16:

```
pdf.set_font('Arial', 'B', 16)
```

We could have specified italics with `I`, underlined with `U` or a regular font
with an empty string (or any combination). Note that the font size is given in
points, not millimeters (or another user unit); it is the only exception. The
other standard fonts are `Times`, `Courier`, `Symbol` and `ZapfDingbats`.

We can now print a cell with [Cell](reference/Cell.md). A cell is a rectangular
area, possibly framed, which contains some text. It is output at the current
position. We specify its dimensions, its text (centered or aligned), if borders
should be drawn, and where the current position moves after it (to the right,
below or to the beginning of the next line). To add a frame, we would do this:

```
pdf.cell(40, 10, 'Hello World!', 1)
```

To add a new cell next to it with centered text and go to the next line, we
would do:

```
pdf.cell(60, 10, 'Powered by FPDF.', 0, 1, 'C')
```

**Remark**: the line break can also be done with [Ln](reference/Ln.md). This
method allows to specify in addition the height of the break.

Finally, the document is closed and sent to the browser with
[Output](reference/Output.md). We could have saved it in a file by passing the
desired file name.

**Caution**: in case when the PDF is sent to the browser, nothing else must be
output, not before nor after (the least space or carriage return matters).
If you send some data before, you will get the error message: "Some data has
already been output to browser, can't send PDF file". If you send after, your
browser may display a blank page.

## Header, footer, page break and image ##

Here is a two page example with header, footer and logo:

```
from fpdf import FPDF

class PDF(FPDF):
        def header(self):
                # Logo
                self.image('logo_pb.png', 10, 8, 33)
                # Arial bold 15
                self.set_font('Arial', 'B', 15)
                # Move to the right
                self.cell(80)
                # Title
                self.cell(30, 10, 'Title', 1, 0, 'C')
                # Line break
                self.ln(20)

        # Page footer
        def footer(self):
                # Position at 1.5 cm from bottom
                self.set_y(-15)
                # Arial italic 8
                self.set_font('Arial', 'I', 8)
                # Page number
                self.cell(0, 10, 'Page ' + str(self.page_no()) + '/{nb}', 
                    0, 0, 'C')

# Instanciation of inherited class
pdf = PDF()
pdf.alias_nb_pages()
pdf.add_page()
pdf.set_font('Times', '', 12)
for i in range(1, 41):
        pdf.cell(0, 10, 'Printing line number ' + str(i), 0, 1)
pdf.output('tuto2.pdf', 'F')
```

[Demo](http://pyfpdf.googlecode.com/hg/tutorial/tuto2.pdf)

This example makes use of the [Header](reference/Header.md) and 
[Footer](reference/Footer.md) methods to process page headers and footers. They
are called automatically. They already exist in the FPDF class but do nothing,
therefore we have to extend the class and override them.

The logo is printed with the [Image](reference/Image.md) method by specifying
its upper-left corner and its width. The height is calculated automatically to
respect the image proportions.

To print the page number, a null value is passed as the cell width. It means
that the cell should extend up to the right margin of the page; it is handy to
center text. The current page number is returned by the PageNo method; as for
the total number of pages, it is obtained by means of the special value `{nb}`
which will be substituted on document closure (provided you first called 
[AliasNbPages](reference/AliasNbPages.md)).
Note the use of the [SetY](reference/SetY.md) method which allows to set
position at an absolute location in the page, starting from the top or the
bottom.

Another interesting feature is used here: the automatic page breaking. As soon
as a cell would cross a limit in the page (at 2 centimeters from the bottom by
default), a break is performed and the font restored. Although the header and
footer select their own font (`Arial`), the body continues with `Times`. This
mechanism of automatic restoration also applies to colors and line width. The
limit which triggers page breaks can be set with 
[SetAutoPageBreak](reference/SetAutoPageBreak.md).


## Line breaks and colors ##

Let's continue with an example which prints justified paragraphs. It also
illustrates the use of colors.

```
from fpdf import FPDF

title = '20000 Leagues Under the Seas'

class PDF(FPDF):
        def header(self):
                # Arial bold 15
                self.set_font('Arial', 'B', 15)
                # Calculate width of title and position
                w = self.get_string_width(title) + 6
                self.set_x((210 - w) / 2)
                # Colors of frame, background and text
                self.set_draw_color(0, 80, 180)
                self.set_fill_color(230, 230, 0)
                self.set_text_color(220, 50, 50)
                # Thickness of frame (1 mm)
                self.set_line_width(1)
                # Title
                self.cell(w, 9, title, 1, 1, 'C', 1)
                # Line break
                self.ln(10)

        def footer(self):
                # Position at 1.5 cm from bottom
                self.set_y(-15)
                # Arial italic 8
                self.set_font('Arial', 'I', 8)
                # Text color in gray
                self.set_text_color(128)
                # Page number
                self.cell(0, 10, 'Page ' + str(self.page_no()), 0, 0, 'C')

        def chapter_title(self, num, label):
                # Arial 12
                self.set_font('Arial', '', 12)
                # Background color
                self.set_fill_color(200, 220, 255)
                # Title
                self.cell(0, 6, 'Chapter %d : %s' % (num, label), 
                    0, 1, 'L', 1)
                # Line break
                self.ln(4)

        def chapter_body(self, name):
                # Read text file
                with open(name, 'rb') as file:
                    txt = file.read().decode('latin-1')
                # Times 12
                self.set_font('Times', '', 12)
                # Output justified text
                self.multi_cell(0, 5, txt)
                # Line break
                self.ln()
                # Mention in italics
                self.set_font('', 'I')
                self.cell(0, 5, '(end of excerpt)')

        def print_chapter(self, num, title,name):
                self.add_page()
                self.chapter_title(num, title)
                self.chapter_body(name)

pdf = PDF()
pdf.set_title(title)
pdf.set_author('Jules Verne')
pdf.print_chapter(1, 'A RUNAWAY REEF', '20k_c1.txt')
pdf.print_chapter(2, 'THE PROS AND CONS', '20k_c2.txt')
pdf.output('tuto3.pdf', 'F')
```

The [GetStringWidth](reference/GetStringWidth.md) method allows to determine
the length of a string in the current font, which is used here to calculate the
position and the width of the frame surrounding the title. Then colors are set
(via [SetDrawColor](reference/SetDrawColor.md), 
[SetFillColor](reference/SetFillColor.md) and 
[SetTextColor](reference/SetTextColor.md)) and the thickness of the line is set
to 1 mm (against 0.2 by default) with
[SetLineWidth](reference/SetLineWidth.md). Finally, we output the cell (the
last parameter to true indicates that the background must be filled).

The method used to print the paragraphs is [MultiCell](reference/MultiCell.md).
Each time a line reaches the right extremity of the cell or a carriage return
character is met, a line break is issued and a new cell automatically created
under the current one. Text is justified by default.

Two document properties are defined: the title 
([SetTitle](reference/SetTitle.md)) and the author 
([SetAuthor](reference/SetAuthor.md)). Properties can be viewed by two means.
First is to open the document directly with Acrobat Reader, go to the File menu
and choose the Document Properties option. The second, also available from the
plug-in, is to right-click and select Document Properties.
