# What is FPDF? #

[FPDF](http://www.fpdf.org) (and PyFPDF) is a library with low level primitives
to easily generate PDF document. This is similar to ReportLab's graphics canvas,
but with some methods to output "fluid" cells ("flowables" that can span 
multiple rows, pages, tables, columns, etc.), it has several methods ("hooks") 
that can be redefined, to fine-control headers, footers, etc.

Originally developed in PHP several years ago (as a free alternative to 
propietary C libraries), it has been ported to many programming languages, 
including ASP, C++, Java, Pl/SQL, Ruby, Visual Basic, and of course, Python.

For more information see: http://www.fpdf.org/en/links.php

# What this library **is not**? #

This library is not a:

  * charts or widgets library (you can import PNG or JPG images, use PIL or any
    other library, or draw the figures yourself, see examples)
  * "flexible page layout engine" like 
    [Reportlab](http://www.reportlab.com/opensource/) PLATYPUS (but can do 
    columns, chapters, etc., see [Tutorial](Tutorial.md))
  * XML /object definition language like 
    [Geraldo Reports](http://www.geraldoreports.org/), Jasper Reports or similar
    (look at [WriteHTML](reference/WriteHTML.md) for simple HTML reports and 
    [Templates](Templates.md) for fill-in-the-blank documents)
  * PDF text extractor/conversor, spltiter or similar. Look at 
    [pyPdf](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyPdf)

# How does this library compares to ...? #

Compared to other solutions, this library should be easier to use and adapt for
most common documents (no need to use a page layout engine, style-sheets 
templates, or stories...), with a full control over the generated PDF document 
(including advanced features and extensions).

It is smaller (a source folder less than 200K) and compilation or external 
libraries are not required.

It includes cell and multi\_cell primitives to draw fluid document like 
invoices, listings/reports, and basic support for HTML rendering.

# How does the code looks like? #

Following is a example similar to the reportlab one at the book of web2py, note
the simplified import and usage:
(http://www.web2py.com/book/default/chapter/09?search=pdf#ReportLab-and-PDF)

PyFPDF:
```python
from fpdf import FPDF

def get_me_a_pyfpdf():
    title = "This The Doc Title"
    heading = "First Paragraph"
    text = 'bla '* 10000

    pdf=FPDF()
    pdf.add_page()
    pdf.set_font('Times','B',15)
    pdf.cell(w=210,h=9,txt=title,border=0,ln=1,align='C',fill=0)
    pdf.set_font('Times','B',15)
    pdf.cell(w=0,h=6,txt=heading,border=0,ln=1,align='L',fill=0)
    pdf.set_font('Times','',12)
    pdf.multi_cell(w=0,h=5,txt=text)
    response.headers['Content-Type']='application/pdf'
    return pdf.output(dest='S')
```

Reportlab:
```python
from reportlab.platypus import *
from reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet
from reportlab.rl_config import defaultPageSize
from reportlab.lib.units import inch, mm
from reportlab.lib.enums import TA_LEFT, TA_RIGHT, TA_CENTER, TA_JUSTIFY
from reportlab.lib import colors
from uuid import uuid4
from cgi import escape
import os

def get_me_a_pdf():
    title = "This The Doc Title"
    heading = "First Paragraph"
    text = 'bla '* 10000

    styles = getSampleStyleSheet()
    tmpfilename=os.path.join(request.folder,'private',str(uuid4()))
    doc = SimpleDocTemplate(tmpfilename)
    story = []
    story.append(Paragraph(escape(title),styles["Title"]))
    story.append(Paragraph(escape(heading),styles["Heading2"]))
    story.append(Paragraph(escape(text),styles["Normal"]))
    story.append(Spacer(1,2*inch))
    doc.build(story)
    data = open(tmpfilename,"rb").read()
    os.unlink(tmpfilename)
    response.headers['Content-Type']='application/pdf'
    return data
```

# Has this library any framework integration? #

Yes, if you use web2py, you can make simple HTML reports that can be viewed in a
browser, or donwloaded as PDF.

Also, using web2py DAL, you can easily set up a templating engine for PDF 
documents.

Look at Web2Py for examples

# What is the development status of this library? #

This library was improved over last years since the initial port from PHP. Some 
code is in early development stages (mainly UTF-8 support and some advanced 
features). The good news are than PHP versions and examples are available since
long time ago, so migration and some bug-fixes are easy.

Said that, a former version is working successfully and is commercially 
supported since late 2008 for electronic invoices templates compliant with AFIP
(Argentina IRS) normative, in several environments (linux, windows, etc.). It 
was originally included in 
[PyRece](http://code.google.com/p/pyafipws/wiki/ProjectSummary), with thousands 
downloads to date.

For further information see:

  * http://www.pyafipws.com.ar/
  * http://code.google.com/p/pyafipws/
  * http://groups.google.com/group/pyafipws

In contrast, WriteHTML support is not complete, so it must be considered in 
alpha state. Further enhancements using web2py helpers and xml parser will 
enable to parse more complex HTML files.

# What is the license of this library (pyfpdf)? #

Original FPDF uses a permissive license:
http://www.fpdf.org/en/FAQ.php#q1

> "FPDF is released under a permissive license: there is no usage
> restriction. You may embed it freely in your application (commercial
> or not), with or without modifications."

FPDF Version 1.6 license.txt says:

fpdf.py is a revision of a port by Max Pat, in the original source uses the same

To avoid ambiguity (and to be compatible with other free software, open source 
licenses), LGPL was chosen for this googlecode project (as Freeware isn't 
listed).

Some FPDF ports had chosen similar licences (wxWindows Licence for C++ port, 
MIT licence for java port, etc.): http://www.fpdf.org/en/links.php

Other FPDF derivatives also choose LGPL, as
