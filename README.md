Arka is a Blender plugin designed to enhance 3D object manipulation and layout optimization. This tool focuses on extracting edges from 3D objects and efficiently packing them on a surface using advanced bin packing techniques.

Features
Extract larger edges from 3D objects and convert them into flat rectangles.
Efficiently pack these rectangles on a surface using the rectpack library.
Capability to print elements on PDF using the pyfpdf library.

Dependencies
This plugin utilizes two key open-source libraries:

rectpack: An advanced bin packing library for Python
pyfpdf: A simple PDF generation library for Python

Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the developers and contributors of rectpack and pyfpdf for making these excellent libraries available and accessible to the open-source community.

Whislist and TODO:
  - adding mm units instead of cm for precission
